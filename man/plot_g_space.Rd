\usage{
plot_g_space(
  env_bg = NULL,
  n_bg = 10000,
  suitable_env = NULL,
  occ_pts = NULL,
  show.occ.density = FALSE,
  colors = NULL,
  palette = "default",
  vs = NULL,
  niche = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{env_bg}{Optional background environment object used when
`suitable_env` is not supplied and suitability must be computed.
Typically a `terra::SpatRaster` (or `raster::Raster*`).}

\item{n_bg}{Integer (currently unused; reserved for future downsampling of
the background grid).}

\item{suitable_env}{Optional precomputed suitable environment object. Can be:
\itemize{
  \item a `data.frame` with columns `x`, `y`, and optionally `dist_sq`,
  \item a `"suitable_env"` object returned by [get_suitable_env()]
        with a `suitable_env_df` component.
}
If `dist_sq` is present, a distance panel is also drawn. If you only
want one surface (e.g., just suitability or just distance), supply only
that information in `suitable_env`.}

\item{occ_pts}{Optional `data.frame` of occurrences with columns `x`, `y`
(assumed longitude/latitude, WGS84). Plotted as points if supplied. If
`vs` is supplied and `occ_pts` is `NULL`, the function will try to use
`vs$occurrences`.}

\item{show.occ.density}{Logical (currently unused; reserved for future
density panels).}

\item{colors}{Optional named list to override aesthetics. Recognized names:
`bg` (basemap fill), `suitable_env` (suitable tiles), `occ_fill`,
`occ_stroke`, and `dist` (RColorBrewer palette name for distance tiles).}

\item{palette}{Character palette key. One of `"default"`, `"palette2"`,
or `"palette3"`.}

\item{vs}{Optional object of class `"NicheR_species"` created by
[create_virtual_species()]. When provided, any of `env_bg`, `niche`,
`occ_pts`, or `suitable_env` that are `NULL` will be filled from this
object if possible.}

\item{niche}{Optional object of class `"ellipsoid"` (from [build_ellps()]).
Required when suitability is computed internally (i.e., when
`suitable_env` is `NULL`).}
}
\value{
A `ggpubr` object produced by [ggpubr::ggarrange()], containing
  one or two map panels plus a matching legend panel.
}
\description{
Draws a world basemap and overlays (a) suitable environments as tiles,
(b) an optional continuous distance-to-centroid surface, and/or (c)
occurrence points. A compact custom legend is built to match the
discrete layers shown.
