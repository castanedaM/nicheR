\usage{
plot_g_space(
  env_bg = NULL,
  suitable_env = NULL,
  occ_pts = NULL,
  show.occ.density = FALSE,
  colors = NULL,
  palette = "default",
  surface = NULL,
  vs = NULL,
  niche = NULL
)
}
\description{
Draws a basemap and overlays (a) suitable environments as tiles,
(b) an optional continuous distance-to-centroid surface, and/or (c)
occurrence points. The map extent is primarily inferred from `env_bg`
(if available), otherwise from the coordinates in `suitable_env` and
finally from `occ_pts`, always with a small buffer where needed.
}
\details{
When a `NicheR_species` object (`vs`) is supplied, any of
`env_bg`, `suitable_env`, `occ_pts`, or `niche` that are `NULL` are filled
using `nr_get_env()`, `nr_get_suitable_all()`, `nr_get_occ()`, and
`nr_get_niche()` respectively.

If `surface` is `NULL`, only the basemap (optionally informed by `env_bg`)
and occurrence points are drawn; no suitability or distance surfaces
are plotted.
